This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking.
We use the Julia programming language to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling.
In this class you will learn computer science, software, algorithms, applications, and mathematics as an integrated whole.

We added the HomeWorks directory to keep tracking of those solved and unsolved files
